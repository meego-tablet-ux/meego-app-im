This file has the pending stasks for the standalone approver:

- Detect when an incoming call has been canceled to remove the hard notification
  and place an incoming call
- Detect when the meego-app-im is running to decide whether to approve or not text channels
  and file transfers
- Make the meego-app-im accept calls directly without showing the incoming dialog
- Check whether there is another incoming call
- Check whether there is an ongoing call
- Save the path to the incoming call sound to gconf (/usr/share/sounds/meego/stereo/ring-1.wav)
